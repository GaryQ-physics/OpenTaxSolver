# For MSYS1.0, define "CFLAGS = -std=c99"
# in your build env.

# Note that under Windows, in an MSYS2 shell, the ".exe" suffix is implied for
# the EXE_* file list macro values. This maintains compatiblity with *nix
# platforms, which don't use the ".exe" suffix for programs.  However, in
# MSYS1, this handling is not automatic; currently, MSYS1 is being used to
# build standalone Windows versions of OTS, since MSYS 2.0 produces exe files
# which fault at startup. TODO: Resolve the MSYS2 build issue, and provide
# instructions for setting up a Windows MINGW build environment.

# EFS = Executable File Suffix; not-defined (empty) for Linux. Includes the "."
# separator.  To detect whether a ".exe" suffix should be added to executable
# file names, The "MSYSTEM" environment variable is detected. If detected,
# regardless of value, a ".exe" file extension is used.
