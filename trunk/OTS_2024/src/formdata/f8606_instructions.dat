Instructions:
[Complete_Part_One?] Complete this part only if one or more of the following apply.
• You made nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA for 2024.
• You took distributions from a traditional, traditional SEP, or traditional SIMPLE IRA in 2024 and you made nondeductible
contributions to a traditional IRA in 2024 or an earlier year. For this purpose, “distributions” does not include rollovers (but does
include certain 2024 retirement plan distribution repayments treated as rollovers (see instructions)). Also, it does not include qualified
charitable distributions, one-time distributions to fund an HSA, conversions, recharacterizations, or returns of certain contributions.
• You converted part, but not all, of your traditional, traditional SEP, and traditional SIMPLE IRAs to Roth, Roth SEP, or
Roth SIMPLE IRAs in 2024 and you made nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA in 2024 or an earlier year.

[L1] If you used the IRA Deduction Worksheet in the Form
1040 instructions or as referred to in the Form 1040-NR
instructions, subtract line 12 of the worksheet (or the
amount you chose to deduct on Schedule 1 (Form 1040),
line 20, if less) from the smaller of line 10 or line 11 of the
worksheet. Enter the result on line 1 of Form 8606. You
can’t deduct the amount included on line 1.
If you used the worksheet Figuring Your Reduced IRA
Deduction for 2024 in Pub. 590-A, enter on line 1 of Form
8606 any nondeductible contributions from the
appropriate lines of that worksheet.
If you didn’t have any deductible contributions, you can
make nondeductible contributions up to your contribution
limit (see Overall Contribution Limit for Traditional and
Roth IRAs, earlier). Enter on line 1 of Form 8606 your
nondeductible contributions.
Include on line 1 any repayment of a qualified reservist
distribution.
Don’t include on line 1 contributions that you had
returned to you with the related earnings (or less any
loss). See Return of IRA Contributions, earlier.

[L2] Generally, if this is the first year you are required to file
Form 8606, enter -0-. Otherwise, use the Total Basis Chart
to find the amount to enter on line 2.
However, you may need to enter an amount that is
more than -0- (even if this is the first year you are required
to file Form 8606) or increase or decrease the amount
from the chart if your basis changed because of any of the
following.
• You had a return of excess traditional IRA contributions
(see Return of Excess Traditional IRA Contributions,
earlier).
• Incident to divorce, you transferred or received part or
all of a traditional, traditional SEP, or traditional SIMPLE
IRA (see the last bulleted item under Line 7, later).
• You rolled over any nontaxable portion of your qualified
retirement plan to a traditional, traditional SEP, or
traditional SIMPLE IRA that wasn’t previously reported on
Form 8606, line 2. Include the nontaxable portion on
line 2.

[L4] f you made contributions to traditional IRAs for 2024 in
2024 and 2025 and you have both deductible and
nondeductible contributions, you can choose to treat the
contributions made in 2024 first as nondeductible
contributions and then as deductible contributions, or vice
versa. - See instruction example

[L6] Enter the total value of all your traditional, traditional SEP,
and traditional SIMPLE IRAs as of December 31, 2024,
plus any outstanding rollovers. A statement should be sent
to you by January 31, 2025, showing the value of each
IRA on December 31, 2024. However, if you
recharacterized any amounts originally contributed, enter
on line 6 the total value, taking into account all
recharacterizations of those amounts, including
recharacterizations made after December 31, 2024.

[L7] See Instructions

[L8] if, in 2024, you converted any amounts from traditional,
traditional SEP, or traditional SIMPLE IRAs to a Roth, Roth
SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRA, enter on line 8 the net amount
you converted.

[L15b] Enter the amount on line 15a attributable to qualified disaster distributions, if any, from 2024 Form(s)
8915-F (see instructions). Also, enter this amount on 2024 Form(s) 8915-F, line 18, as applicable (see
instructions)

[Complete_Part_Two?] Complete this part if you converted part or all of your traditional, traditional SEP, and traditional SIMPLE IRAs to a Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRA in 2024.

[L16] If you didn’t complete line 8, see the instructions for that
line. Then, enter on line 16 the amount you would have
entered on line 8 had you completed it.

[L17] If you didn’t complete line 11, enter on line 17 the amount
from line 2 (or the amount you would have entered on
line 2 if you had completed that line) plus any
contributions included on line 1 that you made before the
conversion.

[Complete-Part_Three?] Complete this part only if you took a distribution from a Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRA in 2024. For this purpose, a
distribution does not include a rollover (but does include certain 2024 retirement plan distribution repayments treated as
rollovers (see instructions)). Also, it does not include a qualified charitable distribution, one-time distribution to fund an
HSA, recharacterization, or return of certain contributions (see instructions).

[L19] See Instructions

[L20] f you had a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution
from your Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRA and you
made a contribution (including a conversion or a rollover
from a qualified retirement plan) to a Roth IRA for any year
from 1998 through 2019, enter the amount of your
qualified expenses on line 20, but don’t enter more than
$10,000 reduced by the total of all your prior qualified
first-time homebuyer distributions. For details, see Are
Distributions Taxable? in chapter 2 of Pub. 590-B.

[L22] CAUTION: If you completed the 2024 Line 25c Worksheet,
include on line 22, the amount, if any, from line 6
of the worksheet.

Figure the amount to enter on line 22 as follows.
(other than an amount rolled over or recharacterized or a
returned contribution), enter on line 22 the total of all your
regular contributions to Roth or Roth SIMPLE IRAs for
1998 through 2023 (excluding rollovers from other Roth,
Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRAs and any contributions
that you had returned to you), adjusted for any
recharacterizations.
• If you did take such a distribution before 2024, see the
Basis in Regular Roth IRA Contributions Worksheet to
figure the amount to enter.
• Increase the amount on line 22 by any amount rolled in
from a designated Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE
account that is treated as investment in the contract.
• Increase or decrease the amount on line 22 by any
basis in regular contributions received or transferred
incident to divorce. Also attach a statement similar to the
one explained in the last bulleted item under Line 7,
earlier.
• Increase the amount on line 22 by the amounts
received as a military gratuity or Servicemembers’ Group
Life Insurance (SGLI) payment that was rolled over to your
Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRA.
[L24] Figure the amount to enter on line 24 as follows.
• If you have never made a Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth
SIMPLE IRA conversion or rolled over an amount from a
qualified retirement plan to a Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth
SIMPLE IRA, enter -0- on line 24.
• If you took a Roth IRA distribution (other than an
amount rolled over or recharacterized or a returned
contribution) before 2024 in excess of your basis in regular
Roth IRA contributions, see the Basis in Roth IRA
Conversions and Rollovers From Qualified Retirement
Plans to Roth IRAs chart to figure the amount to enter on
line 24.
• If you didn’t take such a distribution before 2024, enter
on line 24 the total of all your conversions to Roth IRAs.
These amounts are shown on line 14c of your 1998, 1999,
and 2000 Forms 8606 and line 16 of your 2001 through
2023 Forms 8606. Also include on line 24 any amounts
rolled over from a qualified retirement plan to a Roth, Roth
SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRA for 2008, 2009, and 2011
through 2024 reported on your Form 1040, 1040-SR,
1040A, or 1040-NR, and for 2010 reported on line 21 of
your Form 8606. Don’t include amounts rolled in from a
designated Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE account
because these amounts are included on line 22.
• Increase or decrease the amount on line 24 by any
basis in conversions to Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE
IRAs and amounts rolled over from a qualified retirement
plan to a Roth, Roth SEP, or Roth SIMPLE IRA received or
transferred incident to divorce. Also attach a statement
similar to the one explained in the last bulleted item under
Line 7, earlier.
