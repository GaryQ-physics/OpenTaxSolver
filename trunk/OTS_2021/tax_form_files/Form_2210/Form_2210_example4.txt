 dividends, you can reduce your estimated tax by using the Qualified
 Dividends and Capital Gains Tax Worksheet or other appropriate worksheet to

 item of income and each deduction by the annualization factor for that
 period to estimate your taxable income for the year and then calculate the

 estimated tax version of OTS to calculate the tax due on your estimated
 income for the year that was extrapolated from the information for the
 relevant period.  See instructions for form 2210 and IRS publication 505.}

 the tax tables or tax rate schedules (including Form 1041, Schedule

 period.}
