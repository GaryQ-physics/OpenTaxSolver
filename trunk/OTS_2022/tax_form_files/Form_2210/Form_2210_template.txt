{ The following four fields are for entry of the tax due on the annualized
 income extrapolated from the income and deductions during the respective
 period.  The tax can be calculated using the tax tables or tax rate 
 schedules; however, you may pay more estimated tax than necessary.}
 
{ If you have tax preference items, such as capital gains and/or qualified
 dividends, you can reduce your estimated tax by using the Qualified
 Dividends and Capital Gains Tax Worksheet or other appropriate worksheet to
 calculate the annualized tax due each period.  To do this, multiply each
 item of income and each deduction by the annualization factor for that
 period to estimate your taxable income for the year and then calculate the
 tax on that income using the chosen method.}

{ You may also have, and/or be eligible for, certain credits---some of
 which may be based upon your estimated taxable income for the year.  You
 may be able to reduce one or more of your estimated tax payments by
 including these credits in your tax calculation.  You can use the 2023
 estimated tax version of OTS to calculate the tax due on your estimated
 income for the year that was extrapolated from the information for the
 relevant period.  See instructions for form 2210 and IRS publication 505.}

{ To use your own tax calculation, simply enter it into the box for the
 relevant period.  If you want this program to calculate the tax using
 the tax tables or tax rate schedules (including Form 1041, Schedule
 G for estates/trusts), place a negative value (e.g., -1) into the field.
 This tells the program that you want it to calculate the tax for that
 period.}
